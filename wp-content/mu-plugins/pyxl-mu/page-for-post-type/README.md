# Page for Post Type

Allows you to set a page as the base URL for a post type, much like you can set
a page for your blog posts.

This gives you some flexibility when using plugins or themes that provide
custom post types. It's not unusual to want to nest these a little deeper in
your site's page hierarchy.

## Usage

Just activate it!

The plugin adds a settings section to the reading settings page where you
would normally set a static home page and page for your posts.

You can choose a page to act as your post type archive page and also as the
rewrite slug for posts within that post type.
